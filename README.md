👐 Theremotion is a virtual instrument inspired by the Theremin.

Just like a Theremin, the position of your hand in the air controls the pitch
and volume of the sound. However, you can also control much more dimensions of
the sound with specific motions.

With specific hand positions, you can control a low pass filter, a supersaw
sound, a guitar sound and more. You can even make the instrument "stick" to a
scale, making it much easier to control than a Theremin.

- 👈 Move up and down your left hand to control the pitch.
- 👋 Move your right hand on the horizontal plane to control the filter.
- 👋 Advance left hand on the horizontal plane to play a chord.
- 👌 Pinch with your left hand to stick on a scale.
- 🎸 Pinch with your right hand, and rotate it to play guitar.

## Installation

In order to play with Theremotion you need a [Leap Motion
Controller](https://www.ultraleap.com/product/leap-motion-controller/) and a
compatible Windows PC.

First of all, install the latest version of [Ultraleap's tracking
software](https://developer.leapmotion.com/tracking-software-download).
Theremotion was made for the Gemini software version. The previous version
(Orion) is also supported, though the hand tracking is not as good.

Next, download the latest Theremotion version from the [Github release
page](https://github.com/plule/theremotion/releases).

Extract the archive, and run the executable.

## Tools

[![Leap Motion Controller](site/doc/ultraleap.png)](https://www.ultraleap.com/product/leap-motion-controller/) [![Faust](site/doc/faust.png)]((https://faust.grame.fr/)) [![Rust](site/doc/rust.png)](https://www.rust-lang.org)

The hand tracking is provided by Ultraleap's [Leap Motion Controller](https://www.ultraleap.com/product/leap-motion-controller/).

The sound generation is created with Grame's [Faust](https://faust.grame.fr/).

The program is built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

## Building Theremotion

In order to build Theremotion, you need to install
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and [Ultraleap's tracking
software](https://developer.leapmotion.com/tracking-software-download). If you
wish to modify the sound generation, you also need to install
[Faust](https://faust.grame.fr/).

Build with `cargo build`. When modifying the DSP, set the environment variable
`THEREMOTION_REGEN_DSP` to any value in order to regenerate the DSP code when
running `cargo build`.

If using the Orion version of Ultraleap, build with `cargo build
--no-default-features`.

If the tracking software is installed at a custom path, set the environment
variable `LEAPSDK_LIB_PATH` to the absolute path of the
`Ultraleap/LeapSDK/lib/x64` before running the build.

## License

With the exception of any third-parties (such as the Rust, Faust and Ultraleap
logos, the Ultraleap redistributables, the Noto Emoji font), Theremotion is
distributed under the GPLv3 license.
